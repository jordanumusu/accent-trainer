# Accent Trainer

A pronunciation training application that uses OpenAI Whisper for speech analysis and scoring. The system compares user pronunciation against reference audio generated by espeak-ng TTS, analyzing phonetic accuracy and prosodic features to provide detailed feedback for language learning.

## Structure

- `web/` - Next.js frontend application
- `scorer/` - Python pronunciation scoring backend

## Getting Started

### Web App
```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Scorer Backend
```bash
cd scorer
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## PRONUNCIATION API ROADMAP

### CURRENT STATUS
- Single word pronunciation scoring (7 demo words)
- English, French, Spanish support
- TTS reference audio (espeak-ng)
- Basic prosody analysis
- Docker deployment ready

### MEDIUM TERM IMPROVEMENTS
□ Replace Whisper with wav2vec2 phoneme model
□ Add Montreal Forced Alignment for precise timing
□ Implement GOP (Goodness of Pronunciation) scoring
□ Better prosody: stress detection, intonation analysis
□ Voice activity detection for long audio
□ Multi-sentence and phrase support
□ Fluency scoring (hesitations, pace)
□ Expand to 500+ words per language

### LONG TERM VISION
□ Record native speakers (5-10 per language)
□ Replace TTS with human reference audio
□ Voice matching (find similar reference speaker)
□ Regional accent support (US/UK English, etc)
□ Complete UI redesign with real-time visualization
□ Mobile app (React Native)
□ Progress tracking and analytics
□ API scaling and optimization
□ Sub-500ms latency target
□ Add 10+ languages
□ On-device inference for mobile
□ Personalized error correction
□ Enterprise dashboard and APIs
